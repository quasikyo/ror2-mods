# ReduceRecycler
Sets Recycler cooldown to instant and adds the cooldown to the run timer.

I have not tested this in multiplayer, but users have reported that it works.

## Credits
- Boof, for initial mod concept and in-game general/edge-case testing

## Configuration
- Whether or not no-cooldown should apply only after teleporter

## FAQ

#### Does the time added to the run timer reflect any equipment cooldown reduction (e.g., fuel cells, Gesture)?
Yes.

#### If I have multiple fuel cells, will the mod only activate when the last charge is used?
Yes.

#### Does the config option work in stages without a teleporter (Hidden Realms, Void Fields, Commencement)?
Yes, but enabling the config option will simply make the Recycler behave as normal.
