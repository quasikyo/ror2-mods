## FAQ

#### Does the time added to the run timer reflect any equipment cooldown reduction (e.g., fuel cells, Gesture)?
Yes.

#### If I have multiple fuel cells, will the mod only activate when the last charge is used?
Yes.

#### Does the config option work in stages without a teleporter (Hidden Realms, Void Fields, Commencement)?
Yes, but enabling the config option will simply make the Recycler behave as normal.
