# Contributing
If you are willing to take upon any of the issues listed [here](https://github.com/quasikyo/ror2-mods/issues) or implement some other feature, you are free to do so.

Once you have finished with your fixes/updates/etc., create a pull request to this repository and I will review it at my earliest convenience. Once approved, I will merge it into the main branch and create a new release. You will be attributed in the GitHub release notes and changelogs.
